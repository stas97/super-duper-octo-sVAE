## What is super-duper-octo-sVAE?

A repository where the codebase for Advanced Machine Learning (DTU-course) project "S-VAE" resides.

## Why super-duper-octo-sVAE?

`super-duper-octo` was a generic name suggested by GitHub,the rest is history.  

Git is a cool co-working/versioning/organising tool. Totally worth it to use.  

Other than versioning the code we can discuss doing the following:  
* Protecting the `main` branch and each coding in our own. Then agree on what gets merged into the main and "central" branch by a code review process. This solves the problem of someone left behind on the coding part. At least to some extend. 
* Organising (at least) coding/implementing tasks using Projects/S-VAE:code with a simple board.

## S-VAE

A S-VAE is a variational auto-encoder with a hyperspherical latent space. In our paper we propose to use the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to achieve this, under which the Uniform distribution on the hypersphere is recovered as a special case. Hence this approach allows for a truly uninformative prior, with a clear advantage for data with a hyperspherical latent representation.
